# My dotfiles

Some of my dotfile configuration, which might be useful for others.

## Notes

* My zsh config uses `sans` theme, which can be found at https://github.com/yl3dy/oh-my-zsh-themes
* To match Qt theme to the GTK one in Xfce, add this to `$HOME/.profile`: `export QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=gtk2`
* `.dircolors_solarized_ansi` is taken from https://github.com/seebi/dircolors-solarized
